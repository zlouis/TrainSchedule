###Technologies used###
* jQuery
* Firebase
* HTML
* CSS
* moment.js



A schedule based on trains using time converter and saving the results onto firebase. It was interesting to see how firebase works and able to save the data even after the page refreshes.
A challenging application and it was difficult to update the timers real time and couldn't log how many users were on at the same time.
